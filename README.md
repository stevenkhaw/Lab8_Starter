1. You would fit automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. While this may seem unintuiative early on, this will help catch bugs early on and ensuring that code created is to expected quality as well as meeting its requirements.

2. No.

3. No. This would require quite a few moving parts and would most likely be too complicated to fit inside one unit test. Unit tests are supposed to be quick and do not test how individual components interact with each other on a feature level.

4. Yes. This is a relatively simple test that doesn't go out of bounds and does not have any large-scale moving parts. This can easily be tested as well.
